# Configuration

You can change the global configuration by modifying constant values in `Assets\Plugin\Engine4\Physics\Common.cs`. Each parameter has been annotated [here](xref:Engine4.Physics.Common).

> [!NOTE]
> While there are many options available. By design, only @Engine4.Physics.Common.gravity that can be changed via script in runtime.
