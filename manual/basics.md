# Basics

The basic part of the library is how you understand the concept of fourth-dimension, how to implement this library to scene, and manipulate objects in scene. 

The documentation is expecting you to already know and familiar with how to setup 3D objects in Unity Game Engine.

If you haven't see and play our examples scene, we recommend you to do so!
