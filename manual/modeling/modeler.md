# Modeler Components

Modeler creates the model procedurally from stratch. It is designed to be easy and cache-friendly so you can create whatever complex the shape you want.

Engine4 also has built-in modeler for very basic geometries. You can peek the source code (it's well documented) to give you some ideas how we built them.
