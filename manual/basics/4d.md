# Wrapping your head into fourth dimension

Fourth dimension in a nutshell is a new space direction that indepedently perpendicular to all other directions in 3D world. To avoid misconception, the *fourth dimension* that we use in this term are the fourth dimension in four dimensional euclidean space, not in the [minkowski space-time]()!

## Starting point

There are lot online websites explaining four-dimensional objects in great detail. Here's one example:

## Everything Upgradable

The author of this library believes in `Everything is Upgradable`, means that anything that works in three or lower dimension can be implented in higher dimension, such as 4D.

A very simple example can be inferred from the popular 4D shape *tesseract*, which is an upgrade of a *cube*, which is an upgrade from a *square*, and so on.
