# Welcome to Engine4 Manual v3.0

Engine4 is a library that empowers the ability create four-dimensional scenes inside Unity Game Engine. We aim to develop this library with range of features so you can build more complex scenes without even think how it works.

If you new to Engine4 then go on, otherwise you can click the Manual for usage instructions.

## The Main Goal

Engine4 helps you to create four dimensional scenes inside Unity Game Engine, so you can focus on creating games, not the technical challenges, and think that 'everything' is upgradable to a highe dimension.

## The Secret Sauce

The library is doing the runtime hardwork without external depedencies.  Any input data that feeded into the library are processed into a projected shape that renderable with conventional 3D rendering engines.

## Major Features

+ Builtin Camera, Transformation, Rendering, Builder, Gizmo, Physics Library
+ Exposed API without external libraries + cross platform compatibility
+ Optimized (Coming soon: Hyperthreading)

## Limitations

These Limitation is our TODOs for the next development of the library.

+ Does all the hardwork in single main thread.
+ Only limited set of shapes that supported by the Physics Engine.
+ Building shapes can only done via procedural creations.
