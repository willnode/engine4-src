# Welcome to Engine4 Manual v3.0

Engine4 is a library that empowers the ability create four-dimensional scenes inside Unity Game Engine. We aim to develop this library with range of features so you can build more complex scenes without even think how it works.

If you new to Engine4 then go on, otherwise you can click the Manual for usage instructions.

## The Main Goal

Engine4 helps you to create four dimensional scenes inside Unity Game Engine, so you can focus on creating games, not the technical challenges, and think that 'everything' is upgradable to a higher dimension.

## The Secret Sauce

The library is doing the runtime hardwork without external depedencies. Any input data that feeded into the library are processed into a projected shape that renderable with conventional 3D rendering engines.

Note that because Unity is a 3D Game Engine. Engine4 mostly do not use advanced features inside as it is *limited* to 3D space. 

## Major Features

+ Builtin Datatypes, Camera, Transformation, Rendering, Builder, Gizmo, Physics Library.
+ Full Scripting API without external libraries
+ Cross platform
+ Optimized

## Limitations

These Limitation is our TODOs for the next development of the library.

+ Currently does all the hardwork in single main thread (job system pending).
+ No support for rendering via graphic acceleration (how?).
+ No support for batching (does it makes sense?).
+ No particle generator (yet).
+ Only limited set of shapes that supported by the Physics Engine.
+ Building shapes can only done via procedural creations.
+ Cross section doesn't know how to play with UV.
+ Four-dimensional gizmo isn't properly implemented.
